\title{2B Partial Least Squares for shape data}
\usage{
pls_shapes(X, shapes, tree = NULL, LOOCV = FALSE, recompute = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix with variables as columns and observations as rows,
representing the external variables that supervise ordination
(corresponding to the first block).}

\item{shapes}{Shape data (corresponding to the second block of
\code{pls2b}.}

\item{tree}{A \code{"phy"} object containing a phylogenetic tree. Tip labels
should match the row number and names from \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{LOOCV}{Logical; whether to apply leave-one-out cross-validation.}

\item{recompute}{Logical; whether to re-compute rotation matrix using the
scores resulting from LOOCV.}
}
\value{
A \code{"pls_shapes"} or \code{"phy_pls_shapes"} object formatted
following the \code{"prcomp"} class:
\itemize{
\item \code{$sdev:} {the standard deviation of the PLS axis/axis of the
shape block.}
\item \code{$rotation:} {a matrix of vector coefficients for the shape
block.}
\item \code{$center:} {the mean values of the original variables from
the shape block.}
\item \code{$totvar:} {the sum of the variances from the original
variables in the shape block.}
\item \code{$x2:} {the scores from the supervizing block (i.e. the
\code{x} scores.}
}
}
\description{
A wrapper for \code{\link[=pls2b]{pls2b()}} or \code{\link[=phy_pls2b]{phy_pls2b()}} aimed specifically
at synthesizing covariation between shape data and other external,
non-shape variable(s).
}
\details{
This function finds the linear combination maximizing covariation
between a block of variables assumed to be shape variables formatted as
a 2-margins matrix and another block which can be either another set of
shape variables or one or more non-shape variables for supervizing the
analysis. If a phylogenetic tree is supplied, observations from \code{x}
and \code{shapes} blocks are treated as data measured for its tips.

It has been reported that PLS (as an algebraic equivalent of bgPCA)
produces spurious covariation between blocks when the number of variables
exceeds the number of observations (which is a common situation in
geometric morphometrics analyses). This problem can be alleviated by
carrying out a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV; i.e. each
observation is excluded from the calculation of PLS axes before its
projection in the resulting ordination as a way to calculate its score).

#load data
data("tails")

#extract shapes and sizes, compute mean shapes and sizes for all species, extract tree
shapes <- tails$shapes
sizes <- log(tails$sizes)

sp_sizes <- tapply(X = log(sizes), INDEX = tails$data$species, FUN = mean)
tree <- tails$tree

#perform PLS between shape and size
pls <- pls_shapes(shapes = shapes, X = sizes)

#inspect results
