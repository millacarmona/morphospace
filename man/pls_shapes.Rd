\item{x}{A matrix with variables as columns and observations as rows,
representing the external variables that supervise ordination.}

\item{LOOCV}{Logical; whether to apply leave-one-out cross-validation.}

\item{recompute}{Logical; whether to re-compute rotation matrix using the
scores resulting from LOOCV.}

\description{
A wrapper for \code{\link[=pls]{pls()}} aimed specifically at synthesizing
covariation between shape data and other external, non-shape variables.
