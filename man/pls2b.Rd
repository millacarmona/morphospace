\usage{
pls2b(x, y, LOOCV = FALSE, recompute = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix with one or more variables as columns and observations as
rows, representing the first block.}

rows, representing the second block.}

\value{
A \code{"pls2b"} object, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{$values:} {vector of singular values accounting for the
covariation among blocks explained by each par of axes.}
\item \code{$xrotation:} {matrix of vector coefficients for the first
block.}
\item \code{$yrotation:} {matrix of vector coefficients for the second
block.}
\item \code{$xcenter:} {the mean values of the original variables from
the first block.}
\item \code{$ycenter:} {the mean values of the original variables from
the second block.}

variables from the second block.}
\item \code{$ytotvar:} {the sum of the variances from the original
variables from the second block.}

\description{
Performs 2B Partial Least Squares allowing for leave-one-out
cross-validation, which is useful one the number of variables exceeds the
number of observations (i.e., alleviates spurious covariation between
variables).
}
\details{
Starting with two blocks of variables measured for the same
cases, two-blocks PLS finds the linear combination of variables on each
block maximizing covariation with the variables on the other. In the
context of \code{morphospace}, one or both of these blocks will usually
be a series of shapes arranged as a 2-margins matrix.

It has been reported that PLS (as an algebraic equivalent of bgPCA)
produces spurious covariation between blocks when the number of variables
exceeds the number of observations (which is a common situation in
geometric morphometrics analyses). This problem can be alleviated by
carrying out a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV; i.e. each
observation is excluded from the calculation of PLS axes before its
projection in the resulting ordination as a way to calculate its score).
