\title{Phylogenetic Two-blocks Partial Least Squares}
\usage{
phy_pls2b(x, y, tree, LOOCV = FALSE, recompute = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix with one or more variables as columns and observations as
rows, representing the first block.}

\item{y}{A matrix with one or more variables as columns and observations as
rows, representing the second block.}

\item{tree}{A \code{"phy"} object containing a phylogenetic tree. Tip labels
should match the row number and names from \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{LOOCV}{Logical; whether to apply leave-one-out cross-validation.}

\item{recompute}{Logical; whether to re-compute rotation matrix using the
scores resulting from LOOCV.}
}
\value{
A \code{"phy_pls2b"} object, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{$values:} {vector of singular values accounting for the
covariation among blocks explained by each par of axes.}
\item \code{$xrotation:} {matrix of vector coefficients for the first
block.}
\item \code{$yrotation:} {matrix of vector coefficients for the second
block.}
\item \code{$xcenter:} {the mean values of the original variables from
the first block.}
\item \code{$ycenter:} {the mean values of the original variables from
the second block.}
\item \code{$xtotvar:} {the sum of the variances from the original
variables from the second block.}
\item \code{$ytotvar:} {the sum of the variances from the original
variables from the second block.}
}
\description{
Performs phylogenetic 2B Partial Least Squares allowing for
leave-one-out cross-validation. Experimental.
}
\details{
Similar to \code{\link{pls2b}} but cases are linked by phylogenetic
relationships. Like in the case of \code{\link{phy_prcomp}}, the resulting
axes maximize the residual covariation among blocks left after removing
covariation among blocks accounted by phylogenetic history (assuming a
Brownian model of evolution an 100\% phylogenetic signal, which is
equivalent to setting \code{method = "BM"} in \code{\link[phytools:phyl.pca]{phytools::phyl.pca()}}).
This method display the same variational properties than phylogenetic PCA,
(i.e. centering on the phylogenetic mean; orientation of scores reflect
non-phylogenetic covariation but their variance is not scaled and thus
contain phylogenetic information; for the latter reason, variance of
scores and eigenvalues differ; scores are correlated; etc; see Polly
et al. 2013).

As in other supervised multivariate ordination functions from
\code{morphospace}, leave-one-out cross-validation can be implemented to
alleviate the spurious covariation among blocks that is produced when
the number of variables exceeds the number of cases.
