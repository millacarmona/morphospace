`morphospace` has been built to work with the most common types of geometric morphometrics data that can be found in the paleobiological and evolutionary biology literature. Below, the general capabilities of this package are showcased using three data sets representing these data types and various spatio-temporal scales that are typically addressed when studying evolutionary variation.


### 2D Landmark data


Most of the capabilities for 2D landmark data visualization has been already covered in the 'General usage' vignette. This section will quickly show how to use a curve or set of curves outlining aspects of the phenotype not captured by the chosen landmarks to improve visualizations via TPS interpolation. To do so we use the `wings` data set, which has been taken from Soto et al. (2012) and includes wing shape data from 263 experimentally bred specimens belonging to two recently diverged cactophilic *Drosophila* species, *D. koepferae* and *D. buzzattii*. These two species show preference to different host cacti (columnar cacti from the genus *Trichocereus* and prickly pears from the genus *Opuntia*, respectively) and are considered morphologically cryptic (usually, they can be recognized only from genital morphology). The data set include the centroid size of each wing, as well as information on the host cacti each specimen was bred on, its species, sex, isofemale line, and replica. Also included is a template containing a series of curves describing wing outline and veins (created using `build_template2d`), which will be warped using TPS interpolation and used to generate fancy shape models for our morphospace.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load morphospace as well as geomorph and magrittr
library(morphospace)
library(geomorph)
library(magrittr)
```

```{r}
# Load wing data and extract shapes, centroid sizes, classification of sex and species,
# links between landmarks, template, and phylogenetic tree
data("wings")

shapes <- wings$shapes
sizes <- log(wings$sizes)
species <- wings$data$species
cactus <- wings$data$cactus
line <- wings$data$line
sex <- wings$data$sex
replica <- wings$data$replica
curvs <- wings$template


# Inspect shapes using links
pile_shapes(shapes, wings$links)


# Generate morphospace but use warped wings as background models
mspace(shapes, template = curvs, col.ldm = "red", cex.ldm = 5) %>%
  proj_shapes(shapes = shapes, col = c("blue", "orange")[species], pch = c(1,16)[cactus]) %>%
  proj_groups(groups = species, col = c("blue", "orange"))
title("Morphospace using template")
```

Assume for a second we are interested in exploring whether we can identify morphological differences between species, as well as interspecific differences in the effect of host cacti. The pattern we are seeing suggets that variation in wing morphology is very subtle, that wings of these two species are basically indistinguishable, and that cactus has a large effect on wing morphology. However, there is a lot of 'noise' (i.e. sexual dimorphism, allometric variation, genetic variation, etc) we can get rid of using `detrend_shapes`. We can also use the `mag` argument to magnify variation so it can be more easily interpreted. Finally, we can also extract the morphometric axes describing between-cacti variation within each species using `bg_prcomp`, and project them to see if they show major changes in orientation:


```{r}
# Remove variationassociated to sex, line, replica and size
detr_shapes <- arrayspecs(
  detrend_shapes(lm(two.d.array(shapes) ~ sex * line * replica * sizes)), 
  p = 9, k = 2)


# Compute between-cactus axis for each species 
between_cactus_db <- bg_prcomp(x = two.d.array(detr_shapes[,,species == "Db"]), 
                               groups = cactus[species == "Db"])
between_cactus_dk <- bg_prcomp(x = two.d.array(detr_shapes[,,species == "Dk"]), 
                               groups = cactus[species == "Dk"])


# Generate morphospace using the refined variation, magnify transformation
omar <- par("mar")
par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 6.5), xpd = TRUE)

mspace(detr_shapes, template = curvs, col.ldm = "red", cex.ldm = 5, mag = 3) %>%
  proj_shapes(shapes = detr_shapes, col = c("blue", "orange")[species], pch = c(1,16)[cactus]) %>%
  proj_groups(groups = species:cactus, 
              col = rep(c("blue", "orange"), each= 2), lty = rep(c(2,1), 2)) %>%
  proj_axis(obj = between_cactus_db, col = c("blue"), lwd = 2) %>%
  proj_axis(obj = between_cactus_dk, col = c("orange"), lwd = 2)

legend("topright", inset = c(-0.25, 0), legend = c("D. buzzattii", "D. koepferae"), 
       cex = 0.7, pch = 16, col = c("blue", "orange"), bty = "n", text.font = 3)
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.25, 0.2), legend = c("Opuntia", "Trichocereus"), 
       cex = 0.7, pch = c(1, 16), bty = "n", text.font = 3)
title("'Refined' morphospace using template\n+ between-cacti axes")
```


So, after 'cleaning' the raw variation interspecific differences become apparent with each species occupying different regions of wing morphospace (elongated and more triangular in *D. koepferae*, relatively higher and more rounded in *D. buzzattii*). Also, morphological variation asssociated to host cacti seems to be similar in both species (the projected axes are largely parallel), although *D. buzzattii* shows a more marked differentiation with flies bred on *Opuntia* further displaced to the region of rounded wings.


### Closed outlines


`morphospace` can also handle closed outline data in the form of Fourier coefficients resulting from an elliptic Fourier analysis. For the purposes of import, normalize and and analize this data we rely on the `Momocs` package, and use its `"OutCoe"` format for storing closed outlines as starting point. Below the `mspace %>% proj_*` workflow is applied to the `shells` data set taken from Milla Carmona et al. (2018). This include data from 137 specimens belonging to 4 species of the extinct bivalve genus *Ptychomya*, tracking their shape changes through a 5 million years interval from the Lower Cretaceous of Argentina. The data set includes the information about the shape (measured using 7 harmonics), centroid size, geochronologic age (both relative and absolute), geographic provenance, and taxonomic classification of each specimen.


```{r, message=FALSE}
#Load Momocs
library(Momocs)

# Load data from shells, extract shapes, sizes and classification into species, absolute and relative
# age and locality
data("shells")

shapes <- shells$shapes$coe
sizes <- log(shells$sizes)
species <- shells$data$species
ages <- shells$data$age
bzones <- shells$data$zone
locality <- shells$data$locality


# Pile shapes
pile_shapes(shapes)


# Generate morphospace using raw variation
mspace(shapes, mag = 1, axes = c(1,2), nh = 5, nv = 4, bg.model = "light gray") %>%
  proj_shapes(shapes = shapes, col = species) %>%
  proj_groups(shapes = shapes, groups = species)
title("Morphospace")
```

In this case, we might be interested in the anagenetic variation shown by each species throughout the studied interval. As before, we can use `detrend_shapes` to remove variation associated to nuisance factors (geographic provenance and allometric variation). We do this for species separately, and then use `consensus` to extract the mean shape of the sample.

(*Note: we do this in a two step process for a good reason: when we use* `detrend_shapes` *to detrend shape variation, the grand mean is used by default as the new mean shape of the sample; however by specifying a value or level of* `x` *from the model in the* `xvalue` *argument, we can use that new value as the mean shape for our 'detrended' shape variation. In this case, we are analitically displacing all the shells to the shape they would have if they had attained their species' maximum size)*.

*(Also, note that we don't need* `arrayspecs` *when using* `detrend_shapes` *here, that's because Fourier coefficients are already stored in matrix format)*.


```{r}
# 'Clean' shapes separately for each species, removing 1) variation associated
# to geographic provenance and 2) allometric variation
detr_shapes <- shapes * 0
for(i in 1:nlevels(species)) {
  index <- species == levels(species)[i]

  submod_loc <- lm(shapes[index,] ~ factor(locality[index]))
  detr_shapes0 <- detrend_shapes(submod_loc)

  submod_siz <- lm(detr_shapes0 ~ sizes[index])
  subdetr_shapes1 <- detrend_shapes(submod_siz, xvalue = max(sizes[index]))

  detr_shapes[rownames(detr_shapes) %in% rownames(subdetr_shapes1),] <- subdetr_shapes1
}


# Compute mean shapes
sp_shapes <- consensus(detr_shapes, species)
```


Now we can use `plot_mspace` again to create a more complex hybrid plot combining shape changes associated to PC1 against the time axis. To do so, we do a bit of variable manipulation first to obtain the classification of each specimen to the combination of (relative) age and species, then build the morphospace, then use `plot_mspace` to plot geochronologic age against shape. Finally, we calculate the (absolute) ages from each combination, bind them to the groups means, order them and use that to depict the mean shape changes of each species through time:


```{r, fig.show='hide'}
# Combine species and biozones factors, then compute the mean shapes of the resulting
# groups
sp.bz <- factor(species:bzones)
mshapes_agesxspecies <- consensus(shapes, sp.bz)


# Generate morphospace
msp <- mspace(shapes, nh = 5, nv = 4, bg.model = "light gray") %>%
  proj_shapes(shapes = shapes) %>%
  proj_consensus(shapes = mshapes_agesxspecies) %>%
  proj_groups(shapes = shapes, groups = sp.bz)
```

```{r}
# Plot time axis vs first PC, add legend
omar <- par("mar")
par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 6.5), xpd = TRUE)

plot_mspace(mspace = msp, x = ages, axes = 1, nh = 5, nv = 4, xlab = "Time (MA)",
            col.points = species,  phylo = FALSE, groups = FALSE, mshapes = TRUE)
# Compute and arrange absolute ages for each group, then use it to add and connect mean shapes
xy <- cbind(tapply(ages, sp.bz, mean), msp$gr_centroids[,1])
xy <- xy[order(xy[,1]),]
for(i in 1:4) {
  index <- grepl(x = rownames(xy), pattern = levels(species)[i])
  lines(xy[index,], col = i, lwd = 2)
  points(xy[index,], pch = 21, bg = i)
}
title(' "Stratomorphospace" ')
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.25, 0), legend = paste0("P. ", levels(species)), 
       cex = 0.7, pch = 16, col = 1:nlevels(species), bty = "n", text.font = 3)
```

From these plots we can say that, regarding the shell outline, 1) *P esbelta* is rather different from the rest of the species, 2) *P coihuicoensis* and *P. windhauseni* are very similar to each other, and 3) most of the species show little or no net change over their stratigraphic span (in other words they seem to be under morphological stasis), with the exception of *P. windhauseni* which show a short but noticeable directional trend towards higher shells.



### 3D Landmark data


Last but not least, `morphospace` can also deal with 3D landmark data (my personal preference for importing and normalizing 3D landmark data are the functions from `Morpho`, but other packages can do this too). To show how to apply the `mspace %>% proj_*` workflow we use the `shells3D` data set taken from Milla Carmona et al. (2021), which gathers longitudinal ontogenetic data from 67 specimens belonging to 7 species of the extinct bivalve genus *Steinmanella* from the Lower Cretaceous of Argentina. The shape of these specimens was registered at different sizes using growth lines, and so the data set includes a total of 278 shapes quantified using 90 surface semilandmarks. Also included are the corresponding centroid sizes, the id of the specimen each shape was taken from, and information about biostratigraphic age, taxonomic classification and geographic provenance of each specimen. The surface mesh corresponding to the specimen closest to the consensus of the sample (found using `geomorph::findMeanSpec`) is also included.


The `rgl` package (Murduch & Adler 2021) is responsible for depiction of 3D models, which imposes some important differences in the way `morphospace` functions work. Most importantly, each time `mspace` or `plot_mspace` is called, a `rgl` device will pop up and the user will be asked to rotate a reference shape to a desired orientation. **Do not close or minimize this window**, just expand it and/or rotate and zoom in/out the model and then go to the console and hit Enter there directly. 

We start by loading the relevant packages and set a rotation matrix for rgl models *(you wouldn't normally need this step, but because I since cannot rotate the device when knitting this becomes necessary. However it can also be useful to use it in your workflow too, so you don't need to worry about finding exactly the same orientation over and over again.)*


```{r, include = TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Load Morpho and rgl
library(Morpho)
library(rgl)

# Set a rotation matrix
par3d(userMatrix = 
        matrix(c(-0.92221391,-0.37156740,-0.10704762,0,-0.37703809,
                 0.92551011,0.03568961,0,0.08581252,0.07327446,
                 -0.99361324,0,0,0,0,1), nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
)
```

```{r}
# Load data from 3D shells, extract shapes and classification into species
data("shells3D")

shapes <- shells3D$shapes
sizes <- log(shells3D$sizes)
species <- shells3D$data$species
ind <- shells3D$data$individual
bzones <- shells3D$data$biozone
locality <- shells3D$data$locality
mesh_meanspec <- shells3D$mesh_meanspec


# Pile shapes
pile_shapes(shapes, alpha = 0.2)
```

```{r testrgl, echo = FALSE}
# Pile shapes
pile_shapes(shapes, alpha = 0.2)
rglwidget(width = 700, height = 700)
```

```{r eval = F}
# Create morphospace using raw variation. This is interactive, you need 
# to rotate the 3D model by yourself and then press enter into the console
mspace(shapes, cex.ldm = 2) %>%
  proj_shapes(shapes = shapes, col = species, pch = 16) %>%
  proj_groups(shapes = shapes, groups = species)
title("Morphospace")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#I just couln't find how to make knitr to generate these figures right so my apologies this is the
#best way I found to show them :(
knitr::include_graphics("vignette-unnamed-chunk-24-1.png")
```


We can now focus on ontogenetic shape variation, which was the intention with which this data set was built. Again we resort to `detrend shapes` to remove variation coming from undesired sources (which in this case are bostratigraphic age, geographic provenance and, especialy, individual differneces)


```{r eval = F}
# Remove nuisance variation from the sample, for each species (a couple were registered
# in a single biozone and/or locality, which require little adjustments)
detr_shapes <- shapes * 0
for(i in 1:nlevels(species)) {
  index <- species == levels(species)[i]
  subshapes <- shapes[,,index]
  subind <- ind[index]
  subloc <- locality[index]
  subzone <- bzones[index]

  if(!any(i == c(4, 5))) {
    detr_shapes[,,index] <- arrayspecs(
      detrend_shapes(model = lm(two.d.array(subshapes) ~ subind * subzone * subloc)),
      p = nrow(shapes), k = ncol(shapes))
  } else {
    if(i == 4){
      detr_shapes[,,index] <- arrayspecs(
        detrend_shapes(model = lm(two.d.array(subshapes) ~ subind)),
      p = nrow(shapes), k = ncol(shapes))
    } else {
      detr_shapes[,,index] <- arrayspecs(
        detrend_shapes(model = lm(two.d.array(subshapes) ~ subind * subloc)),
      p = nrow(shapes), k = ncol(shapes))
    }
  }
}
```


As with 2D landmarks we can include a template to improve interpretability, although in this case this template is a 3D surface mesh. This can slow down the process a bit, especially if we ask for too many models or use transparent meshes. The template used must be the mesh corresponding to the mean shape of the sample, which needs to be computed beforehand (the `shells3D` data set includes the mesh corresponding to the specimen closest to the consensus, which can be warped using `Morpho::tps3d` to obtain the mean mesh, as shown in the next chunk).


```{r eval = F}
# Generate morphospace using raw variation, but with a mesh template that improves
# visualization:

# First, get shape corresponding to shells3D$mesh_meanspec using geomorph::findMeanSpec,
meanspec_id<- findMeanSpec(shapes)
meanspec_shape <- shapes[,,meanspec_id]


# Then get consensus shape and warp the mean spec mesh to get the mesh corresponding to the
# consensus using Morpho::tps3d
detr_meanshape <- consensus(detr_shapes)
detr_meanmesh <- tps3d(x = mesh_meanspec , refmat = meanspec_shape, tarmat = detr_meanshape)
```


Once we got rid of the noise and have our template prepared, we use the refined shapes to compute the ontogenetic allometric axis of each species using `pls_shapes`. Then, we use the former to generate a morphospace in which to project the latter, using 3D meshes as background shape models. 


```{r eval = F}
# Compute allometric axis of each species using pls_shapes
pls_list <- lapply(1:nlevels(species), function(i) {
  index <- species == levels(species)[i]
  subshapes <- detr_shapes[,,index]
  subsizes <- sizes[index]

  pls_shapes(shapes = two.d.array(subshapes), X = subsizes)

})


# Generate morphospace from refined variation and project allometric axis, add legend
omar <- par("mar")
par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 6.5), xpd = TRUE)

msp <- mspace(detr_shapes, template = meanmesh, bg.model = "gray", 
       cex.ldm = 0, invax = 1, adj_frame = c(0.9, 0.85)) %>%
  proj_shapes(shapes = detr_shapes, cex = 0, col = species)
for(i in 1:nlevels(species)) {
  proj_axis(obj = pls_list[[i]], mspace = msp, lwd = 3, col = i, type = "b",
            cex = c(1,2), axis = 1, pipe = FALSE)
}
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.25, 0), legend = paste0("P. ", levels(species)), 
       cex = 0.7, pch = 16, col = 1:nlevels(species), bty = "n", text.font = 3)
title("Refined morphospace")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("vignette-unnamed-chunk-27-1.png")
```


We could use `plot_mspace` to plot the allometric axis (computed as a PLS of shape and size of the entire sample, rather than species-wise). Again we can use all the R machinery to add extra elements, in this case the values expected under the linear regression of shape on log-size.


```{r eval = F}
# Create allomorphospace (I'm just making up names at this point) using PLS 
# to emphasize allometric variation (this could take a while)
amsp <- mspace((detr_shapes), FUN = pls_shapes, X = sizes, LOOCV = TRUE, axes = c(1,1),
                   bg.model = "gray", cex.ldm = 0, template = meanmesh, invax = 1, plot = FALSE)

# Use plot_mspace to create hybrid morphospace with shape against logsize, add legend
omar <- par("mar")
par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 6.5), xpd = TRUE)

plot_mspace(amsp, x = sizes, axes = 1, col.points = species, points = FALSE, 
            xlab = "log-size", xlim = range(sizes), adj_frame = c(0.9, 0.85))
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.25, 0), legend = paste0("P. ", levels(species)), 
       cex = 0.7, pch = 16, col = 1:nlevels(species), bty = "n", text.font = 3)
title(' "Allomorphospace "')
for(i in 1:nlevels(species)) {
  index <- species == levels(species)[i]
  mod <- lm(allomorphospace$x[index,1] ~ sizes[index])
  #dat <- cbind(sort(sizes[index]), mod$fitted[order(sizes[index])])
  #lines(dat, col = i, lwd = 2)
  dat <- cbind(sizes[index], mod$fitted)
  points(dat, cex = (sizes[index]/max(sizes[index]))^3, pch = 21, bg = i)
}
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("vignette-unnamed-chunk-28-1.png")
```


A quick assessment of these plots tells us that there are two main groups of ontogenies: those from *S. quintucoensis* and *S. subquadrata* (which go from roughly quadrate shells with expanded posteriors to more rectangular shells) and the rest of the species, whose ontogenetic trajectories seem to be very similar in terms of orientation and magnitude (all of them go from more oval-like shells to more triangular ones, although the position of the trajectory differs). The exception is *S. vacaensis*, which show a protracted trajectory which reach some very elongated shell shapes. It is also apparent that the common trend is one of anteroposterior elongation, which seems to be more marked for the two species reaching larger sizes (*S. pehuenmapuensis* and *S. vacaensis*).
